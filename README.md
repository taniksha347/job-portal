# job-portal 
The backend of our Job Portal Website is built to provide a robust, scalable, and secure foundation that powers all key functionalities of the platform. It handles data storage, business logic, user authentication, and communication between job seekers and employers efficiently.

Core backend features include:

Database Management: Stores and manages large volumes of user profiles, job listings, applications, and company data with optimized queries for quick retrieval.

User Authentication & Authorization: Implements secure login and role-based access control to protect sensitive information and ensure that users (candidates, recruiters, admins) have appropriate permissions.

RESTful APIs: Facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and backend, enabling dynamic content loading, job search filtering, application submissions, and notifications.

Application Tracking System: Tracks the status of each job application and maintains audit logs for employers and applicants.

Real-time Notifications: Integrates messaging queues or push notifications to alert users about new job postings, interview schedules, or application updates.

Data Security & Privacy: Uses encryption, secure protocols (HTTPS), and regular backups to safeguard user data and comply with privacy regulations.

Scalability & Performance: Designed to handle high traffic loads and concurrent requests through load balancing, caching mechanisms, and asynchronous processing.

This backend infrastructure ensures a smooth, responsive, and reliable job portal experience, supporting both the job seekers’ and employers’ needs effectively.
